# BAH_AI_transportation-
Transportation management environment and reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize traffic problems. 

# to get dynaq results: 
python solve_DynaQ_traffic.py 

* traffic_env.py -- model of environment 
* Dynaq_traffic.py -- model of dynaq algorithm 
* play_traffic_env.py -- some commands you can use to interact with traffic environment 
* solve_dynaq_traffic.py -- run dynaQ
